cd /home/user/Desktop/greenPipes
2. Now run the bash file using following command:
bash Install_linux.sh

B) Unix (????):
1. Open terminal in unix based operating system and navigate to the directory of greenPipes by using cd command e.g.
cd /Applications/greenPipes
2. Now run the bash file using following command:
bash Install_unix.sh

C) Windows (testing on Windows 10) in CMD:
1. Open CMD in window and navigate to the directory of greenPipes by using cd command e.g.
cd C:\Documents and Settings\Users\Desktop\greenPipes
2.  Now run the bat file using following command:
Install_window.bat

D) Windows (testing on Windows 10) in powershell:
1. Open powershell in window and navigate to the directory of greenPipes by using cd command e.g.

2. By default, PowerShell restricts running scripts for security reasons. You may need to change the execution policy to allow running scripts. To do this, execute the following command in the PowerShell window:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
3. Run the script using the script's filename with the .ps1 extension:
./Install_powerShell.ps1
4. If you encounter an error that says "execution of scripts is disabled," you can run the script by bypassing the execution policy:
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\script.ps1
